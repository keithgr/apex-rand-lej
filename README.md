# Apex Legends Squad Randomizer
Welcome to the Apex Legends Squad Randomizer. This is a project hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) that enables you to roll random squad compositions for the battle royale game, Apex Legends. Join a room with your friends, and you can view the results together, in realtime, no matter where you are located. Go to the website [here](https://randlej.glitch.me), or view the project page [here](https://glitch.com/~randlej).

## Platform

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents a form the visitor can use to submit a color name, sending the submitted value to the back-end API running on the server. The server returns info to the page that allows it to update the display with the chosen color. ðŸŽ¨

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!
